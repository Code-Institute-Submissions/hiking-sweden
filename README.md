# Hiking Sweden
Hiking Sweden is a site for the best hiking spots in sweden, all the way from north to south.
You can search for the best spot and find it on the map.
## UX

This hiking site is intended for hikers who want to hike the best spots in sweden.

The index site section contains three clickable options and a map:

- Search
  - When clicking the search text a search box will be visible for the user. In this box can the user make 
    different search options which will appear on the map and will be viewed as pins in the results box. 
    In mobile view the result box will not be visible.
  
- Notes
  - When clicking the notes text a notepad will be visible for the user. The user can take notes from the
    locations they want to visit. There is an option to add notes and delit notes.
  
- Contact
  - When clicking the contact a contact-us form will be visible for the user. The user can send a
    request or ask for questions that they will have answered.

- Map
  - The map is visible all the time. When the user is searching for a location in the search area it will be
    visible on the map. When the user click on a result pinn, some information about the hiking spot is visible
    for the user to read. If the hiking spot has a web page and then clickt the user will open that information in
    a new window.
